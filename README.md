Have you been sometimes spent a lot of time on *social media* and *video sharing*
*websites*? Is the *monkey* in your mind taking over the *steering wheel* (See
[Tim Urban's talk] on procrastination)? We share with you this that helps you remain
focused on a topic of study for extended periods. It does this by **blocking**
**distracting websites** for a specified period of time. It also provides a **timer** to
help you keep track of **your study time**. Use this along with the [Pomodoro technique]
to get the most out of your time.

When its study time, you can set a *fixed duration*, such as `25 min`, or leave it
blank to continue for an *unspecified duration*, and click `Start`. We include four
different **modes** of blocking websites. These include `Novice`, `Competent`, `Professional`,
and `Legendary`.

- `Novice` mode closes blocked websites afer `20 min`.
- `Competent` mode closes blocked websites afer `5 min`.
- `Professional` mode closes blocked websites afer `1 min`.
- `Legendary` mode closes blocked websites **immediately**.

Higher modes are rewarded with more **bounty**, and as your bounty increases, your
**rank** increases from `Cadet` to `Cadet II`, `Officer`, and so on (this is our
gamification element). This extension is currently in *beta*, and we are working
on adding more features. We would love to hear your feedback and suggestions.

We have included a *default* **blocklist** of websites that are distracting. You can
add more websites to the list by adding their *domain names* to the list. You can
also *exclude websites* from the list, or *include remote lists* of websites to
block. See the example below for details.

```
# Let's block a site
apple.com

# Or
# - apple.com

# Now, let's allow a site
+ google.com

# Let's block sites using the default list
! default

# You can also block using default sub-lists
# ! default-video
# ! default-social

# You can also block sites using custom lists
